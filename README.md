This project implements a **Kore-compatible token architecture** for managing **compliant digital securities** and franchise-backed token offerings under **Reg A and Reg D exemptions** in the U.S. private capital markets.

BFTKN is not an investment platform. It is a **technical tokenization stack** designed to be integrated with Kore's compliance infrastructure, investor onboarding flows, and Transfer Agent services.

---

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Purpose

This project serves as the foundation for a **white-labeled, self-service platform** enabling franchise owners, founders, and issuers to launch compliant token offerings while relying on **regulated intermediaries via Kore** for:

- Transfer agent functions
- Investor onboarding (KYC/AML, accreditation, escrow)
- Cap table management
- Secondary trading integrations

---

## üîê Compliance Scope

This repository is intended for **technology demonstration and integration** with Kore's services. It **does not**:

- Act as a broker-dealer or match investors to issuers
- Facilitate securities clearing or custody
- Serve as an MTL-compliant payment platform
- Collect success fees or investor funds

All regulated functions will be handled by Kore and/or their partners.

---

## ‚úÖ Kore-Compatible Features

- Compliant role-based access control (owner, admin, KoreOperator)
- Funding window enforcement (`setFundingWindow`)
- Whitelist-based minting with fee logic
- Optional bonding curve toggle (permanently lockable)
- Partial/full fee exemptions (issuer-configurable)
- Mint/burn support + rollover event logic
- Pausable contract with admin override
- Full TypeScript + Hardhat test suite
- Deployment + integration-ready environment
