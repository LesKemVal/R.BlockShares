# R.BlockShares

A Tokenization Platform for compliant business franchise investments.

## Overview

This repository includes the `BusinessFranchiseToken` smart contract and supporting deployment and test files intended to meet the Kore protocolâ€™s compliance and audit framework.

- **Smart Contract:** `contracts/core/BusinessFranchiseToken.sol`  
  Implements a capped ERC20 token with:
  - Role-based access control
  - Configurable funding rounds
  - Bonding curve pricing
  - Investor rollover logic for unfilled rounds

- **Deployment Script:** `scripts/deploy-business.ts`  
  Automates deployment using environment-configurable parameters.

- **Test Script:** `test/test-full.ts`  
  Simulates investor flows, funding logic, rollover mechanics, and fee distribution scenarios to reflect real-world use cases.

- **Network:** Sepolia testnet (for testing); prepared for mainnet deployment pending Kore review.
